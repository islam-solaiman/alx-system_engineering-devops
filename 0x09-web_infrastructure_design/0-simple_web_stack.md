# Description

This is a simple web infrastructure that hosts a website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. There are no firewalls or SSL certificates for protecting the server's network. Each component (database, application server) has to share the resources (CPU, RAM, and SSD) provided by the server.

* What is a server ?

A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client. On the Internet, the term "server" commonly refers to the computer system that receives requests for a web files and sends those files to the client.

* What is the role of the domain name ?

domain name is the location of a website. For example, the domain name "google.com" points to the IP address "216.58.216.164". Generally, it's easier to remember a name rather than a long string of numbers.

* What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com ?

www.foobar.com uses an A record.
www.foobar.com is an A record because it resolves to an IP addess.
This can be checked by running dig www.foobar.com.
Note: the results might be different but for the infrastructure in this design, an A record is used.
Address Mapping record (A Record)â€”also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.

* What is the role of the web server ?

A web server is a computer system capable of delivering web content to end users over the internet via a web browser.
Web servers are primarily used to process and manage HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses from the client system.

* What is the role of the application server ?

The application server is a framework, an environment where applications can run, no matter what they are or what functions they perform. An application server can develop and run web-based applications.

* What is the role of the database ?

database is a large quantity of indexed digital information. It can be searched, referenced, compared, changed or otherwise manipulated with optimal speed and minimal processing expense.

* What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website ?

Communication between the client and the server occurs over the internet network through the (TCP/IP) protocol suite.
