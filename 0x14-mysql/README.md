# 0x14. MySQL

This project is about  configuring database servers in a primary-replica model. configured the two servers provided  by ALX in a MySQL primary-replica setup with a dummy database, and wrote a Bash script to automate generation of database backups.

# TASKS:

## Task0: Install MySQL

First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

	- MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
	- Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
	- Please make sure you have your README.md pushed to GitHub.

## Task1: Let us in!

n order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

	- Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
	- Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
	- In addition to that, make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. You will likely need to add the public key to web-02 as you only added it to web-01 for this project. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status

## Task2:  If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes

In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

	- Create a database named tyrell_corp.
	- Within the tyrell_corp database create a table named nexus6 and add at least one entry to it.
	- Make sure that holberton_user has SELECT permissions on your table so that we can check that the table exists and is not empty.

## Task3: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.

	- The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password you’d like.
	- replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
	- holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.
